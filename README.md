Emulator Lua Scripts

This repo is for Emulator Lua Scripts for FCEUX.  It's a replacement for the old repo spiderdave-lua-stuff.  Consider that one outdated, and will probably be removed at some point.  My goal for this is to have the scripts organized, and possibly include a launcher and downloader (sort of a package manager). to help update them.

What you will need:

* Windows
* FCEUX - Download at https://fceux.com/web/download.html.  I personally use the FCEUX 2.6.6 win64 Binary as of this writing.
* The script and all the files.  Previously I had an update.exe to make this easier, and I'm going to remake it but for now you have to manually download from github.
* Run FCEUX
* "File" --> "Open Rom... --> "Castlevania II - Simon's Quest (USA).nes"
* "File" --> "Lua" --> "New Lua Script Window..." --> "Browse..." --> (select a script such as SpiderDave_Castlevania2.lua) --> "Run"

Note: There are a lot of things unfinished, broken or exploitable at the moment :(
